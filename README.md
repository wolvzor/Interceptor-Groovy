Interceptor
===========

Known issues:
- Fighter images do not load from a built interceptor jar - hence the program only currently works from an IDE.
This will be fixed in a later checkin.

TODO (short term):
- Add hexGrid back in w/ improved drawing
- Fix resource loading from a build executable jar
- Clean up current images (asteroids)

TODO (near):
- targeting phase and targeting assignments
- basic weapon resolve phase
- armor/shield rep for fighers
- weapon templates
- resolve weapon effects on fighter shield/fighter
- internal damage point counter

TODO (long term):
TBD
